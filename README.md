# l4srs
Rust implementation of the Log 4 Shell (log 4 j - CVE-2021-44228)

This version will let you build command classes, dynamically serve
a mini meterpreter that runs in a thread of the exploited Java app,
and runs the LDAP and HTTP servers.  This version servers both the
LDAP and HTTP requests from the same port.
